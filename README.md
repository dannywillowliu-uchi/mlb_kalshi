## Risk Management

### Risk Guidelines
- Position sizing: Based on your risk tolerance and account size
- Stop losses: Use strategically (e.g., -2Â¢ price move)
- Monitor PAL: Be aware of $25K Position Accountability Level
- Track performance: Monitor win rate and P&L throughout session

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Execution (>500ms)
- Switch from WiFi to mobile data (or vice versa)
- Use linked 5g hotspot, try different carriers.
- Reduce position sizes by 50%
- If persists >2 seconds, stop trading (edge is gone)

### Authentication Errors
- Token auto-refreshes every 25 minutes
- If manual refresh needed, do between innings
- Never trade while auth status uncertain

### Low Liquidity Warning
- Check orderbook depth before trade
- Only trade if >500 contracts available
- Reduce position size to match liquidity
